# 24-Hour Analog \& Digital Clock

This project is a hands-on study to deepen my understanding of JavaScript. The goal was to create both an analog and digital clock that displays time in a 24-hour format. The project started from a tutorial I followed (Video Reference: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlAw_kd2608) ) to understand the clock's functionality, but I expanded upon it by adding a digital clock, making the design responsive, and personalizing it with my own branding.

## Project Motivation

I’ve always been fascinated by 24-hour analog clocks, but I found it challenging to find one that suits my needs, whether physically or online. This project was an opportunity to create my own. Due to how challenging it can be to read the minutes on the 24-hour analog clock, I added a 24-hour digital clock as well to make reading the time easier.
